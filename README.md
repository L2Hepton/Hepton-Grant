## üìù Guidelines
We welcome all projects that focus on powerful technology to apply for the grant, to use the technology to increase the values of the ecosystem.

If your project meets the following requirements, it'll be more likely to get approved for the grant:

1. The project proposes a concept that has been well-researched or tested. If possible, you can present some of the research work that has been done before.
2. The team of the project can provide a clear commitment to the technology, additional funding source or the business mode to guarantee that the project can be well operated after receiving the grants.
3. Convincing evidence that the project team has strong expertise and technical background. We will require the GitHub personal profiles of all the team members and check their activities and coding quality. Of course, you can also provide projects on other platforms.
4. The project is rich in technical details and is well-defined.
5. Cutting edges of the project to distinguish itself from others, or to present us how to develop technologies that do not exist in the ecosystem yet.

In addition, the following requirements must also be met:

1. Code generated as part of the authorization must be open source, and cannot rely on closed source software. We prefer apache2.0, but GPLv3, MIT and Unlicense are also acceptable.
2. We will not grant projects that have successfully sold the tokens.
3. Any projects involving gambling, illegal transactions, money laundering or criminal activities are prohibited.
4. Any projects involved in copyright or -related are prohibited.

We attach great importance to licensing and the rights of all teams inside and outside the ecosystem and we want all their work to be seriously recognized. For any project found using the research results of others without attribution or there's evidence that the work is not done by oneself, the project will be terminated immediately. If you have any questions about how to comply with a specific license, please contact us before application.



## üìùApplication process
1. Fork this repository.

2. In the new fork, create a copy of the application template (kcc-grants/Open Grant Proposa Content Template.md). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you need to create a new file and copy the contents of the template to it. Please DO NOT modify the template file. 
 
3. Rename the new file as project_name.md.

4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review of your application will be. If you're only applying for a smaller grant concerning UI work, you don't need to provide as much details.

5. Once the template is done, create a pull request. The pull request should contain only one new file, which is the Markdown file you created from the template.
